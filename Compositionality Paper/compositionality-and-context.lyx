\begin_layout Title
Compositionality and Context-Dependency in Natural Language Semantics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Peter Blouw
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Accounting for the fact that many linguistic expressions seem to take on
 different meanings in different contexts is a central problem in the philosophy
 of language.
 The standard solutions to this problem involve either (a) relabelling most
 forms of context-sensitivity as a pragmatic rather than semantic phenomena,
 or (b) using compositional rules to create formal representations of meaning
 that only take on definite values in a particular contexts.
 In this paper, I evaluate complaints against both approaches.
 The issue in the case of (a) is that the problem of accounting for context-sens
itivity is simply punted into the domain of pragmatics where it is left
 largely unsolved.
 The issue in the case of (b) is that the semantic rules used to generate
 meanings become intractably numerous once their behavior is uniquely defined
 for each possible context.
 Because of these issues, I argue that a constraint-based linguistic formalism
 recently used describe adjective-noun combinations offers a better approach
 to describing how meanings of phrases and sentences can be both compositional
 and context-dependent at the same time.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle of compositionality states that the meaning of a complex expressio
n is fixed by its syntactic structure and the meanings of its simpler parts
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Szabo:2012a,FodorLepore:1991"

\end_inset

.
 In the study of natural language semantics, this principle is typically
 taken to entail that expressions such as phrases and sentences are interpreted
 in the following two-step manner 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Recanati:2012"

\end_inset

: first, a set of a lexical rules are used to assign meanings to simple
 expressions; then, a set of composition rules are used to combine these
 simple meanings into the meaning of a phrase or sentence.
 A compositional semantics for a language is accordingly given by a finite
 number of instances of the following two rule schemes

 Conventional wisdom states that if natural languages were not compositional
 in the manner spelled out by (1) and (2), it would be impossible to explain
 the capacity of language users to produce and comprehend indefinitely large
 numbers of sentences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Szabo:2012a,Szabo:2012b"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nonetheless, an important challenge to the idea that natural languages are
 compositional arises from the fact that many expression types seem to take
 on different meanings in different contexts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Recanati:2005,Unnsteinsson:2014"

.
 Consider, for example, the following sentence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mike finished John's book
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Recanati, 2004, p.
 62)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is highly plausible that the proposition expressed by this sentence can
 vary depending on whether Mike finished reading the book or finished binding
 it

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The genitive construction 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John's book
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can also exhibit variation depending on whether, for instance, John wrote
 the book or John owns the book.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 But if the verb 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

finished
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is assigned a fixed meaning as per (1), then it is not clear how to account
 for this variation, since it cannot be attributed to a change in syntactic
 structure or a modification of the lexical constituents in the sentence.
 Many philosophers accordingly think that certain verbs like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

finish
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 make context-sensitive semantic contributions to the sentences in which
 they occur 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "CappelenLepore:2005"

\end_inset

.
 Similar reasoning has been used to produce arguments favoring the context-sensi
tivity of a wide range of expressions containing quantifiers, gradable adjective
s, counterfactual conditionals, and various philosophically loaded terms
 such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knows

\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The status of these arguments is controversial, but they highlight an important
 philosophical problem: there are good reasons for thinking that meanings
 are compositional 
\shape italic
and
\shape default
 context-sensitive, yet there are equally good reasons for thinking they
 cannot be both.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, I evaluate two general approaches to solving this problem.
 The first approach, referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

minimalism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, preserves the standard picture of compositionality while appealing largely
 to pragmatics to account for the apparent context-sensitivity found in
 natural language 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "CappelenLepore:2005"

\end_inset

.
 The second approach, referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

contextualism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, revises the standard picture of compositionality to allow features of
 context to influence the behavior of certain lexical rules and composition
 rules 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Recanati:2005,Recanati:2012"

\end_inset

.
 I evaluate typical formulations of both approaches and conclude that they
 are inadequate.
 The problem with minimalism is that it makes semantics largely irrelevant
 to an explanation of human communication 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Recanati:2005"

\end_inset

, while leaving pragmatics largely mysterious.
 The problem with contextualism, highlighted by Unnsteinsson (2014), is
 that it often involves introducing new parameters into rules such as (1)
 and (2) that simply bring about some observed form of context-sensitivity.
 This simply amounts to relabelling context-sensitivity as parameter-sensitivity.
 Moreover, by redefining the behavior of each rule in each possible context,
 the inclusion of these parameters has the implausible consequence of requiring
 competent language users to have knowledge of an intractably large number
 of rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of these problems, I favor an alternative approach that assigns
 a meaning to a complex expression by optimally satisfying a set of constraints
 that are introduced by the expression's simpler constituents and its context
 of utterance.
 This approach has two important benefits: first, it accounts for the observatio
ns about communication that motivate both minimalism and contextualism;
 and second, it accounts for these observations using a relatively small
 number of theoretical entities.
 Of course, the use of constraint-based formalisms in the development of
 linguistic theory is not a novel idea 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "see e.g.,"
key "PrinceSmolensky:1997,SmolenskyLegendre:2006a"

\end_inset

.
 But it is novel, to my knowledge, to propose that such a formalism can
 offer a promising solution to the philosophical problem of understanding
 how natural languages can be both context-sensitive and compositional at
 the same time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is an outline of the rest of the paper.
 First, I provide a critical analysis of standard contextualist and minimalist
 views.
 Second, I use this critical analysis to motivate the use of a constraint-based
 approach to linguistic theorizing that has largely been ignored by philosophers.
 For concreteness, I discuss an application of this approach to the semantics
 of privative adjectives (Oliver, 2014), and suggest how this sort of applicatio
n could be generalized to a wider range of expression types.
 Third, I revisit the phenomena that motivate contextualism and minimalism
 and argue that these phenomena are naturally handled using ranked constraints.
 I conclude that a constraint-based approach to natural language semantics
 is viable and promising alternative to the status quo.

\begin_layout Subsection
Minimalism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minimalism is the view that the semantic content expressed by a word or
 sentence is largely invariant across contexts.
 In more concrete terms, the view can be summarized by the following claims

\begin_layout Standard
For present purposes, it is helpful to think of minimalism as a view that
 fits very closely with the picture of compositionality presented in (1)
 and (2).
 The reasons for favoring minimalism are accordingly similar to the reasons
 for favoring compositionality.
 In short, minimalism explains how we are able to use indefinite numbers
 of sentences across indefinite numbers of contexts without undertaking
 the impossible task of memorizing rules for each sentence and context.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cappelen and Lepore (2005) provide a recent and influential defense of minimalis
m.
 Their argument is comprised of the following three claims.
 First, anyone who posits context-sensitivity 
\shape italic
somewhere
\shape default
 outside of the basic set of expressions has to posit context sensitivity
 
\shape italic
everywhere
\shape default
 in order to remain consistent.
 Radical contextualism, in short, is the only viable form of contextualism.
 Second, radical contextualism is an implausible view.
 It rules out the possibility of people understanding one another's utterances.
 Third, minimalism is only view that is able to explain how people are able
 communicate the same proposition across a variety of different contexts.
 A successful defense of these claims warrants the conclusion that minimalism
 is preferable to contextualism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is helpful to consider each claim in a bit more detail.
 To establish that moderate forms of contextualism inevitably collapse into
 radical contextualism, Cappelen and Lepore primarily make use of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

context shifting arguments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 designed to illustrate how different uses of the same expression can state
 different things.
 To give an example, consider the sentence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is no 1984 Bordeaux left
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This sentence might express something true in a context involving a restaurateu
r checking the inventory of her wine cellar, but it might express something
 false in the context of a discussion of wines that are currently available
 on the world market.
 Contextualists routinely make this kind of argument to establish that a
 certain expression type is context sensitive.
 The problem, according to Cappelen and Lepore, is that if these arguments
 can be used to illustrate that some sentences are context sensitive, then
 they can be used to illustrate that 
\shape italic
all
\shape default
 sentences are context sensitive.
 For instance, it is straightforward to develop a context shifting argument
 that applies to an arbitrary expression such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John went to the gym
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (2005, p.
 44).
 In different contexts, this expression could mean that John walked to the
 gym, that John exercised at the gym, or that John oversaw a construction
 job at the gym.
 To concede that context-shifting arguments can be generated for arbitrary
 sentences is to concede radical contextualism.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One point to note here is that the presence of linguistic phenomena such
 as ambiguity, vagueness, polysemy, metaphor, and syntactic ellipsis needs
 to be ruled out in order to infer any genuine form of context-sensitivity
 from a context-shifting argument 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with radical contextualism, in turn, is that it requires speakers
 to have shared access to numerous contextual features in order to understand
 one another.
 These contextual features include things like the topic of prior conversation,
 the identities and goals of the speakers, the surrounding environment,
 and anything else that could put to use in a context-shifting argument
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 123-24"
key "CappelenLepore:2005"

\end_inset

.
 If the presence or absence of a given contextual feature can make the differenc
e between a person saying 
\shape italic
x
\shape default
 and saying 
\shape italic
y
\shape default
, then speakers need to have shared access to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 collection of contextual features in order to successfully disambiguate
 the content expressed by a particular sentence.
 Yet speakers rarely, if ever, have such shared access to such features,
 so it becomes unclear how the radical contextualist can explain their ability
 to communicate with one another.
 The resulting argument against radical contextualism is simple: if context
 plays a pervasive role in determining what is said, then people would not
 be able to effectively communicate; yet people clearly are able to effectively
 communicate, so it must not be true that context plays a pervasive role
 in fixing what is said.
 As such, radical contextualism is false.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This argument leads to directly to Cappelen and Lepore's third claim in
 favor of minimalism.
 Their view is that each sentence expresses a context invariant 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

minimal proposition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that is generated through rules like (1) and (2).
 Since these minimal propositions can be interpreted through the application
 of a finite number of semantic rules known to all competent language users,
 they ensure that speakers are able to successfully communicate the same
 contents across different contexts.
 For example, Cappelen and Lepore claim that an utterance of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The apple is red
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 expresses the minimal proposition < the apple is red > regardless of whether
 the context of utterance favors an interpretation on which the flesh rather
 than the skin of the apple is said to be red.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Just to clarify, red apple flesh might be salient in a context in which
 people are looking for apples infected with a fungus that stains the normally
 white flesh red.
 See Cappelen and Lepore (2005, p.
 111) for details about the example.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A listener need not be aware of this context in order to understand what
 has been said.
 Her knowledge of the semantic rules of english allow her to easily conclude
 that the speaker has stated that 
\shape italic
the apple is red
\shape default
, full stop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What, then, is one to make of the observations that motivate philosophers
 to argue that there is widespread semantic context-sensitivity in natural
 language? Cappelen and Lepore respond by briefly outlining a view - 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

speech act pluralism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - on which every utterance expresses a minimal proposition along with an
 indefinite number of 
\shape italic
other
\shape default
 contents.
 These other contents are what shift across the conditions described in
 standard context-shifting arguments, but it is not the job of a semantic
 theory to give an account of them.
 Rather, it is the job of a theory of speech acts.
 And speech acts, on Cappelen and Lepore's view, resist simple analysis.
 They argue that what is stated by a particular utterance can depend on
 facts unknown to the speaker entirely.
 For example, if John says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My boss is running the marathon next week
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and John's boss also happens to be sixty years old, then it is true, on
 Cappelen and Lepore's view, that John has stated that a sixty year old
 is running the marathon next week, even if John is completely ignorant
 of his boss's age.
 Generalizing from this kind of example leads Capellen and Lepore to conclude
 that every utterance expresses an indefinite number of propositions.
 Moreover, they concede that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there might not be 
\shape italic
any
\shape default
 systematic theory from which one can derive all which is said by an utterance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (p.
 200, original emphasis).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two major problems in Capellen and Lepore's analysis that I wish
 to highlight.
 The first concerns their description of the conditions under which communicatio
n is possible.
 Their argument against radical contextualism, recall, claims that if context
 can make a difference to the meaning of essentially any sentence, then
 successful communication can only occur on the implausible condition that
 speakers have shared access to exactly the same context.
 I think that this argument relies on drawing a false dichotomy between
 perfect communicative success and complete communicative failure.
 Consider once more an utterance of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John went to the gym
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A person who hears this utterance while ignorant of the fact that John
 manages a construction project at the gym will not be entirely misinformed.
 They will be able to correctly answer certain questions (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is John?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), draw certain inferences (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John is not at home
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), and plan certain actions (e.g.
 meet John at the gym later in the day).
 On the other hand, a person who does have relevant background information
 about John might be able to answer further questions (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is John working?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and draw further inferences (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John is probably wearing his construction outfit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), but these additional communicative results can characterized in terms
 of one person having a richer understanding of the content expressed by
 the utterance.
 Context, in short, often functions to supplement or modify the contents
 conventionally expressed by particular sentence types.
 Speakers are aware of this fact and accommodate it.
 They ask questions to resolve confusion (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is John doing at the gym?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), and they supply additional information when a lack of shared context
 is apparent (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John went to the gym to manage his construction crew
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Overall, context-sensitivity presents a manageable obstacle to communication,
 not a complete roadblock.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second major problem concerns Cappelen and Lepore's choice to label
 (most) context sensitivity as a pragmatic phenomenon.
 Their description of speech act pluralism commits them to a view on which
 speech act content is radically context sensitive.
 But if so, then communication should be just as hard for them to explain
 as it is for those who think that 
\shape italic
semantic
\shape default
 content is radically context sensitive.
 The issue here is that if speakers need mutual access to a context in order
 to share semantic contents, then they should also need mutual access to
 a context in order to share speech act contents.
 To explain, suppose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John went to the gym
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 semantically expresses the proposition < John worked out at the gym > in
 one context, and the proposition < John walked to the gym > in another
 context.
 Suppose too, along with Cappelen and Lepore, that language users would
 not be able to identify the proposition semantically expressed by this
 sentence unless they know all the facts about the context of utterance.
 If so, then the threat of miscommunication is apparent.
 Unfortunately, this line of reasoning is equally persuasive (or unpersuasive)
 if we simply make reference to speech act content instead of semantic content.
 Suppose an utterance of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

John went to the gym
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used to assert that John worked out at the gym.
 The content of this assertion is the proposition < John worked out at the
 gym >.
 Alternatively, suppose the utterance is used to assert that John walked
 to the gym.
 Now the content of the assertion is the proposition < John walked to the
 gym >.
 As before, if language users do not know all the facts about the context
 of utterance, then they will not be able to determine which speech act
 has been performed.
 The threat of miscommunication is now just as apparent as it was before.
 Overall, Cappelen and Lepore's speech act pluralism faces 
\shape italic
exactly
\shape default
 the same problems that lead them to reject radical contextualism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minimalism, in summary, is a view that is attractive because it preserves
 the standard picture of compositionality (and its attendant explanatory
 benefits) by pushing the burden of explaining context sensitivity onto
 a theory of pragmatics.
 But absent a satisfying pragmatic account of context-sensitivity, this
 strategy is suspiciously reminiscent of gerrymandering.
 A main goal of linguistic theory is to elucidate the relationship between
 context and content, and minimalism simply abandons this goal within the
 domain of semantics while failing to pick up the slack within the domain
 of pragmatics.
 Speech act pluralism offers no precise explanations of how utterances involving
 quantifiers, counterfactual conditionals, genitives, and gradable adjectives
 communicate different contents in different contexts.
 Given such a state of affairs, perhaps it is better to reconsider the possibili
ty that features of context widely influence the behavior of the semantic
 rules that assign contents to sentences.
 This is precisely the approach that many contextualists adopt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contextualism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contextualism is the view that semantic context sensitivity is present in
 numerous expressions outside of the basic set of indexicals.
 One starting point for developing a contextualist view is the observation
 that many sentences cannot be assigned complete propositions through semantic
 rules like (1) and (2).
 For example, a genitive construction like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Paul's car is fast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is arguably only truth-evaluable if the nature of Paul's relation to the
 car is specified 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 62"
before "see"
key "Recanati:2005"

\end_inset

.
 This relation might involve ownership (e.g.
 Paul owns the car), temporary possession (e.g.
 Paul rents the car), desire (e.g.
 Paul wants to drive the car), selection (i.e.
 Paul cheers for the car during a race), or any number of other things.
 Furthermore, a rule like (2) cannot specify the relation in question because,
 on the standard assumption that semantic composition occurs via function
 application, the combination of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Paul's
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

car
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must always return the same semantic value.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Unless, of course, there is lexical ambiguity involving the terms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Paul
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

car
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

.
 (A lexicalization of the possessive construction is assumed here following
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 Positing such ambiguity does not have much prima facie plausibility.
 Another option would be treat 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Paul's car
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as Kaplanian character (i.e.
 a function from contexts to contents) - Recanati's

 approach is along these lines.

 is not the sort of thing that can be true or false in the absence of contextual
 elaboration.
 Observations of this kind suggest that the compositional machinery favored
 by minimalists is simply not up to the task of developing a complete semantics
 for natural language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recanati (2004) offers a well-known defense of contextualism.
 His arguments are motivated by two complementary observations.
 On the one hand, the contents assigned to sentences through rules like
 (1) and (2) can fail to specify a complete proposition, as in the above
 example.
 By arguing that this sort of failure is a universal phenomenon (i.e.
 that sentences never express determinate propositions in the absence of
 contextually salient background assumptions), Recanati aims to show that
 the notion of a linguistically mandated, minimal proposition is incoherent.
 On the other hand, even if minimal propositions exist, they are almost
 never cognitively accessible to language users and therefore have no role
 to play in theories of linguistic communication.
 Overall, Recanati thinks that context is what makes up the difference between
 incomplete and complete propositions in the first case, and between psychologic
ally unavailable and available propositions in the second case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In developing these arguments, he primarily focuses on the issue of psychologica
l availability.
 As such, it is helpful to condense his position into the following two
 claims:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	
\backslash

It should be clear that these claims are tension with the view that meanings
 are determined in a compositional manner.
 Put simply, compositionality enforces a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

bottom up
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 determination of meaning in accordance with linguistic convention, while
 Recanati's availability constraint requires the presence of additional

 effects that introduce things like background assumptions, speaker intentions,

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The notions of bottom up and top down processes might seem a bit vague here,
 but the basic idea is that a bottom up process is linguistically specified
 and mandatory, while a topic down process is pragmatically specified and
 optional.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How persuasive is the first claim that an expression's content must be cognitive
ly available to normal language users? By and large, Recanati's argument
 involves an appeal to increased explanatory insight.
 In numerous examples, what speakers are conscious of having said is not
 what the traditional semanticist defines as such.
 Take, for instance, the expression 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have already eaten breakfast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 8"
key "Recanati:2005"

\end_inset

.
 According to the semanticist, the content of this expression is a proposition
 that is true just in case the speaker has eaten breakfast at least once
 in the past.
 Yet in ordinary circumstances, the speaker would claim to have said no
 such thing (and a listener would likewise claim to have heard no such thing).
 Rather, what is cognitively available to both the speaker and the listener
 is the proposition that the speaker has had breakfast 
\shape italic
today
\shape default
.
 Overall, if one wishes to explain these psychological properties of language
 users, then one needs a notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is said
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that makes doing so possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is where Recanati's second claim becomes important.
 He views the assignment of a cognitively available proposition to a linguistic
 expression as a process that is influenced by a combination of mandatory
 and optional processes referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saturation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

modulation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Saturation, to explain, is the linguistically controlled assignment of
 a context-sensitive semantic value to an expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 7"
key "Recanati:2005"

\end_inset

.
 To give a standard example, the indexical expression 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be thought of as a variable takes on different semantic values in different
 contexts via saturation.
 Moreover, the assignment of a value to the variable follows a simple linguistic
 convention: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to the speaker, regardless of any extralinguistic facts.
 Similar conventions apply for indexicals such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

here
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which refer to the time and place of utterance, respectively.
 As such, saturation is a process controlled by the rules of language.
 Moreover, saturation is mandatory, since sentences containing unsaturated
 constituents fail to express complete propositions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modulation is a different phenomenon on both counts.
 It is the process by which the content assigned to a particular expression
 is adjusted in an optional manner by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

top down
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 processes.
 For example, in the case of the sentence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've had breakfast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a typical modulation would involve extending the content of the sentence
 to include a temporal qualifier (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've had breakfast 
\shape italic
today
\shape default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This kind of extension behavior is referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free enrichment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Other forms of modulation include 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

loosening
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in which the extension of a predicate is expanded to include more things
 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The city is 
\shape italic
asleep
\shape default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; p.
 34, emphasis added), and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semantic transfer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in which an expression takes on a new referent that is related to its
 typical referent in some contextually salient way (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\shape italic
The ham sandwich
\shape default
 left without paying
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, spoken in the context of a dine-and-dash; p.
 26).
 The most important thing to note about all of these examples is that there
 are no specific rules that mandate particular modulations in particular
 situations.
 For example, a sentence like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The city is asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might in one case be modulated such that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to the inhabitants of a city, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remains unmodulated.
 In another case, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might be modulated to mean something 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quiet and inactive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remains unmodulated.
 The choice between these two options depends on the background assumptions
 and intentions of the speakers, not on the rules of english.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To return now to the point at issue, Recanati defense of the second claim
 is essentially an enumeration of examples in which modulations are required
 to get from the minimal proposition associated with a particular sentence
 to the cognitively available one.
 Some of these examples, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've had breakfast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, have already been discussed.
 Other, more interesting examples involve situations in which the processes
 of saturation and modulation are interdependent on one another.
 For instance, Recanati (2004, p.
 61-64) offers an extended discussion of a hypothetical scenario in which
 five gladiators are each made to fight a wild animal, one of which is a
 lion.
 The gladiators wear decorative shields, and one gladiator's shield depicts
 a roaring lion.
 The scenario concludes with each animal lying dead with a gladiator's sword
 through its body.
 Afterwards, Recanati imagines an utterance of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bring me the lion's sword - I want to have a look at it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (p.
 63), and notes that this utterance is ambiguous.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could refer either to the dead animal or the warrior with a lion on his
 shield.
 In the former case, the possessive construction will pick out a relation
 that holds between an animal and a sword that killed it, while in the latter
 case, the possessive construction will pick out a relation that holds between
 a warrior and the sword he or she used.
 If modulation favors a non-literal interpretation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then the possessive construction must be saturated to indicate the relation
 between warrior and weapon.
 On the other hand, if saturation favors a relation between an animal and
 a sword, then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be left unmodulated.
 The upshot of this example is that mandatory process of specifying the
 nature of the possessive relation between lion and sword cannot be carried
 out in isolation from the optional process of modifying the referent of
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This interdependence of these processes, one traditionally thought of as
 semantic and the other pragmatic, casts considerable doubt on the minimalist's
 claim that semantic interpretation is strictly prior and independent of
 pragmatic interpretation.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is said
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by Recanati's imagined utterance cannot,be determined by the rules of language
 alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this argument is persuasive, a remaining challenge concerns the fact
 that modulation is not easily reconciled with a compositional explanation
 of linguistic understanding.
 To deflect this criticism, Recanati 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "Recanati:2012"

\end_inset

 proposes a view on which rules like (1) and (2) are modified to incorporate
 parameters that are sensitive the context of use.
 These context parameters, in turn, signal which saturations and modulations
 ought to play a role assigning a semantic value to a particular linguistic
 expression.
 For instance, to account for saturation, Recanati (2012, p.
 188-89) considers the following revised compositional rule schemes: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
,I(e_{2})_{c2})$  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
end{itemize}
\end_layout

\end_inset

The first scheme can be read as describing the interpretation of expression
 
\shape italic
e
\shape default
 in context 
\shape italic
c
\shape default
, and defines a higher-order interpretation function that returns a mapping
 from contexts to meanings for all simple expressions in the language.
 The second scheme is equivalent to (2) except insofar as the arguments
 to the semantic composition function 
\shape italic
g
\shape default
 are context-dependent as per (1a).
 To illustrate the application of these rule schemes, consider again the
 example of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I already ate breakfast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The expression 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has a function from contexts to contents as its meaning; this function
 returns different contents when different speakers utter the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The other expressions (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

already
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, etc.) are by assumption in no need of saturation, so they are interpreted
 in the usual manner.
 However, (1a) and (2a) are consistent with minimalism, since they roughly
 schematize a compositional semantics that incorporates Kaplanian characters
 for handling indexicals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Something slightly more sophisticated is required to account for the modulations
 that differentiate minimalism from contextualism.
 Recanati's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
after "p. 189-90"
key "Recanati:2012"

\end_inset

 proposal is to introduce a higher-order function, 
\shape italic

\shape default
, that takes expression-context pairs as arguments, and returns a function
 that maps from meanings to meanings as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula $mod(e,c)=g_{ec}:m\rightarrow m$

, where 
\shape italic

 is the domain of semantic values

One could make this approach more sophisticated by typing the semantic values

\end_layout

\end_inset

 With this modulation function in place, a further revision to the basic
 rule schemes of (1) and (2) is provided:

end{itemize}
\end_layout

\end_inset

As a brief word of explanation, these rule schemes allow each (potentially
 complex) constituent in a linguistic expression to modulated in a unique
 way.
 The benefit of this generality is that modulations can occur with arbitrary
 syntactic scope.
 For example, a modulation might apply to a simple constituent (e.g.
 the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city is asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) or an entire sentence (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've had breakfast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 One can likewise imagine modulations that apply specifically to noun phrases,
 prepositional phrases, and a variety of other syntactic categories.
 Overall, if this account of compositionality is plausible (and Recanati's
 earlier claims concerning the cognitive availability of what is said are
 convincing), then there is little reason not to adopt a contextualist position.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major problem with Recanati's proposal lies in fact that a context parameter
, 
\shape italic
c
\shape default
, is passed as an argument to every function corresponding to a semantic
 rule (i.e.
 every instance of (1b) and (2b)).
 As Unnsteinnson (2014, p.
 3340-41) notes, this entails that each rule's behavior is defined uniquely
 for each context.
 The behavior of 
\shape italic
mod
\shape default
, for example, is defined uniquely for each possible expression-context
 pair, returning a specific modulation function, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ec}$
\end_inset

, for each such pair.
 If this is true, then understanding a language implausibly requires memorizing
 an infinite number of rules to go along with the infinite number of possible
 contexts in which the expressions of the language might be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In defense of Recanati, one might suppose that the possible context parameters
 are abstract and few in number.
 But in this case, Unnsteinsson notes that the proposal simply fails to
 offer any explanatory insight.
 To explain, if 
\shape italic
mod
\shape default
 delivers the contextually appropriate modulation function for every linguistic
 expression, then the behavior of 
\shape italic
mod
\shape default
 simply restates the contextualist assumption that linguistic expressions
 can have their meaning affected by features of context.
 The context parameters, 
\shape italic
c
\shape default
, do all of the heavy lifting, and Recanati is silent on what is included
 in these parameters.
 Are they speaker intentions? Background assumptions? If so, how are they
 represented? Overall, Unnsteinsson is right to argue that introducing context
 parameters throughout the rules defining a language's semantics is too
 general an approach to be explanatory.
 Put simply, the strategy amounts to little more than relabelling context-sensit
ivity as parameter-sensitivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minimalists and contextualists are best thought of as providing different
 solutions to the same problem.
 The minimalist proposes to account for context-sensitivity using the tools
 of speech act theory.
 The contextualist, on the other hand, proposes to account for context-sensitivi
ty by adding a rich store of modulations into semantic theory.
 These differences aside, there are aspects of both positions that are clearly
 correct.
 The minimalist, in my view, is right to highlight the fact that each simple
 linguistic expression contributes some constant ingredient into the determinati
on of an utterance's content.
 If this were not true in some broad sense, one would be stuck with the
 implausible conclusion that the words used in an utterance place no constraint
 on its content.
 Where the minimalist goes too far is in supposing that words place 
\shape italic
inviolable
\shape default
 constraints on this content.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contextualist, on the other hand, is quite right to highlight the communicat
ive irrelevance of minimal propositions.
 If a main goal of semantics is to explain linguistic communication, then
 a semantics that describes utterances in terms of contents that are unrecogniza
ble to language users is simply inadequate.
 The minimalist tries to avoid this problem by gesturing towards an account
 of pragmatics that maps context-invariant semantic contents onto context-sensit
ive speech act contents.
 But as Recanati illustrates, it is nearly impossible to enforce this clean
 separation between semantics and pragmatics.
 If one thinks of semantic content as the result of saturation and speech
 act content as the result of modulation, then it is clear from examples
 like the phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the lion's sword
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that semantic and pragmatic interpretation are mutually dependent processes.
 The former is not strictly prior to the latter.
 Something along the lines of Recanati's revised composition schemes is
 evidently needed.
 The drawback of these schemes is they give rise to a situation in which
 the behavior of every semantic rule is different in every context.
 What is needed, then, is a framework that allows both linguistic expressions
 and features of context to mutually constrain the assignment of content
 to an utterance without extravagantly multiplying the entities that impose
 these constraints.
 The optimization-based approach described in the next section, I argue,
 can meet this challenge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Optimization and Semantic Composition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of Recanati's most important insights is that interpretation of one
 constituent in a sentence can constrain the interpretation of another.
 Recall the sentence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The city is asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is interpreted metonymically, then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be interpreted literally.
 On the other hand, if 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is interpreted literally, then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must undergo loosening.
 One way to think about this phenomenon is to suppose that there a set of
 candidate semantic values for each expression, and that a process of constraint
 satisfaction selects the candidates that minimizes the degree to which
 the constraints in question are being violated.
 Recanati (2004) hints at this idea, but does not pursue it in much detail:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In the model I have in mind, the literal meaning of [an] expression is accessed
 first and triggers that activation of associatively related representations.
 That literal meaning is a natural candidate for the status of semantic
 value, but there are others: some of the representations activated by associati
on activate further candidates for the status of semantics value.
 All candidates, whether literal or derived, are processed in parallel and
 compete.
 When an interpretation that fits that broader context of discourse is found,
 it is selected...and the other candidates are suppressed.
 (p.
 28)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between these ideas and the more formal notions that underlie
 Recanati's approach to compositionality is not clear.
 It is hard, for instance, to interpret rules like (1b) and (2b) as performing
 the kind constraint satisfaction described in the above quote.
 Fortunately, there are other tools that one can use to describe the process
 by which an optimal semantic value is chosen from amongst a set of candidates.
 The framework of optimality theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "PrinceSmolensky:1997"

\end_inset

 offers a powerful way to describe linguistic phenomena in terms violable
 patterns and soft tendencies rather than hard and fast rules.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Optimality Theory 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In brief, optimality theory characterizes a speaker's knowledge of a language
 in terms of a set of soft constraints on the well-formedness of linguistic
 structures.
 This approach contrasts with more traditional formalisms in which well-formedne
ss is measured in a binary fashion.
 A standard context-free grammar, for example, consists of a set of symbolic
 rewrite rules that generate all and only the sentences (or parse trees)
 that belong to a language.
 A categorial grammar of the sort described by Carpenter (1997) behaves
 in much the same way: a sequence of words either admits of a derivation
 of a particular lambda term expressing its meaning, or it does not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An optimality-theoretic grammar, by comparison, scores parse trees (or lambda-ca
lculus expressions; see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) along a continuum and in accordance with a set of constraints.
 Prince and Smolensky's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "PrinceSmolensky:1997"

\end_inset

 motivation for adopting this approach is that the linguistic structures
 comprising a language often exhibit conflicting tendencies.
 For example, they note that English sentences tend to display a pattern
 in which a subject clause is followed by a verb, which is in turn followed
 by an object clause.
 This pattern is not universal, though.
 The sentence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What did John see?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (p.
 1604), for instance, places the object rather than the subject first.
 Arguably, this is because a constraint favoring the placement of question
 words like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the beginning of sentences is stronger than the constraint favoring
 subject-verb-object word order.
 The key conclusion drawn from theses observations is that, in many instances,
 no possible linguistic structure can satisfy all relevant constraints.
 Producing a syntactically well-formed utterance, as such, involves selecting
 a linguistic structure that violates fewer constraints than any other structure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimality-theoretic analyses can be tailored to a number of different domains,
 but all such analyses exhibit a few properties in common 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "SmolenskyLegendre:2006a"

\end_inset

.
 First, there is an input to be analyzed and mapped to an output.
 Second, there is candidate space that defines a number of possible outputs
 for the input under consideration.
 In a standard parsing task, for example, the input would an English sentence,
 and the candidate space would consist of a set of potential parses of the
 sentence.
 Third, a collection of ranked constraints is used to evaluate each candidate
 and assign it a score.
 To be precise, each constraint can be thought of as function that defines
 a mapping between candidates and scores 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Oliver:2014"

\end_inset

.
 Each candidate's total score is the sum of all the scores assigned to it
 by these mappings.
 The scores, in turn, assign an ordering to the set of candidates, and the
 top-most element in this ordering is selected as the optimal output for
 the input under consideration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "PrinceSmolensky:1997"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, the constraint set used to evaluate the candidate space is partially
 contingent on the nature of the input.
 Or put another way, different inputs introduce different constraints into
 the evaluation process.

 A

 A

 A

 adjective, finally, is an adjective that specifies the material making
 up some set of entities picked out by a noun.
 Sometimes these adjectives behave intersectively (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

marble statue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), but others behave privatively (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

glass bird
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Oliver's aim is to provide a unified account of constitutive material adjective
s using the resources of optimality theory.
 What follows is an extended summary of his approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two examples provide the basis of Oliver's discussion: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grey newspaper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which behaves intersectively, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which behaves privatively (since a stone lion is not actually a lion).
 To account for these examples, Oliver gives each constituent word (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grey
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, etc.) an analysis on which it specifies a collection properties.
 Next, each such property is assumed to impose a constraint on the evaluation
 of the space of candidate semantic values for the compound expression being
 interpreted.
 The candidates themselves, in turn, are equivalence classes of entities,
 and each constraint favors an equivalence class in which all entities have
 a property specified by the constraint.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The motivation for choosing equivalence classes as candidates is that doing
 so allows for an exhaustive specification of the candidate space, since
 each constraint corresponds to a property that can be used to partition
 the domain of entities into two classes (i.e.
 the class of entities that all have the property, and the class of entities
 that all do not).
 The addition of a new constraint re-partitions all classes specified by
 existing constraints, such that the total number of candidate equivalence
 classes is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 lexical constraints are present.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These candidates are given formal represenations below for clarity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evaluation proceeds by starting with the highest ranked constraints and
 ruling out any candidates that violate them.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is definitive of optimality theory that the constraints be ranked in
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strict domination hierarchy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 such that no amount of satisfaction of lower ranked constraints can compensate
 for the violation of a higher ranked constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 1604"
key "PrinceSmolensky:1997"

\end_inset

.
 This restriction is motivated on empirical grounds.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Then, the next highest ranked constraints are considered and the process
 is repeated.
 Once all constraints have been evaluated, the remaining candidate is chosen
 as optimal.
 (If more than one candidate remains, they are all equally optimal; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "SmolenskyLegendre:2006a"

\end_inset

).
 In Oliver's framework, the constraints introduced by a single lexical constitue
nts are ranked equivalently and treated as a group, but each group is ranked
 relative to the others in accordance with linguistically motivated meta-constra
ints, as discussed below.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This use of meta-constraints is presented as a virtue because they ostensibly
 give more generality and explanatory power to the account than would be
 achieved if rankings were simply stipulated to account for the chosen examples
 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The example of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grey newspaper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can help illustrate.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grey
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is taken to impose two constraints on the evaluation process: the chosen
 equivalence class should include those entities that are (a) physical objects,
 and (b) grey colored.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

newspaper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, on the other hand, is taken to impose three constraints: the chosen equivalenc
e class should include those entities that (a) are readable, (b) are published
 by an institution of some sort, and (c) encode information in a physical
 object.
 As such, there two collections of constraints (i.e.
 one for each constituent in the phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grey newspaper
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that can be used to evaluate a candidate space consisting of representations
 of all classes that exhibit a possible configuration of the properties
 over which the constraints are defined.
 Evaluation proceeds by considering the constraints introduced by each lexical
 item in decreasing order of strength.
 For example, one can suppose initially that the adjective group takes precedenc
e, and start by evaluate using the constraints imposed by

 Evaluation proceeds by summing asterisks over the rows and ordering the
 candidates accordingly.
 In this case, evaluation selects the candidate in row (a), which incurs
 no violations and denotes the equivalence class of entities that are both
 grey and physical objects.

where again each row corresponds to a candidate equivalence class, each
 column corresponds to a constraint, and each asterisks indicates that the
 candidate in the corresponding row violates the constraint in the corresponding
 column.
 Again, the candidate in row (a) is selected because it incurs the least
 number of constraint violations.
 Notably, this result is equivalent to finding the intersection of the sets
 picked out by each property corresponding to a constraint.
 Intersection occurs because none of the constraints in question conflict.
 If, however, the constraints do conflict, then their relative ranking determine
s which result takes precedence.

The expression

 A single constraint is introduced by the word

 made of stone.
 Three constraints are introduced by the word

\end_inset

: that the chosen equivalence class should include those entities that (a)
 are animals, (b) have the appearance of a lion, and (c) are the offspring

 Since there is no set of entities both made of stone and born to lions,
 these constraints cannot all be satisfied.

\begin_layout Standard
A number of the candidate classes are ruled out because they contain nothing
 (these candidates are marked with a struck-out row letter).
 Of the remaining candidates (f) and (h), the highest ranked one is (f)
 .
 As such, the optimization process produces as its output a representation
 that picks out a class of entities that are made of stone and have the
 appearance of a lion (i.e.
 the combined expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\lnot A(x)\wedge L(x)\wedge\lnot O(x)\wedge S(x)$
\end_inset

 ).
 In short, the optimization process produces a representation that correctly
 refers to stone lions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what if an alternative ranking is chosen in which the constraints supplied
 by the noun take precedence over the constraints supplied by the adjective?
 In this case, the highest ranked class of entities in the first stage of
 the analysis would be those entities referred to by the expression 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Formula $A(x)\wedge L(x)\wedge O(x)$
\end_inset

.
 
\shape default
The second stage of analysis is thus restricted to rule out any candidates
 that conflict with this initial result (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $S(x)$
\end_inset

 is removed from consideration since it would result in an empty extension).
 As such, the selected output is a representation that simply refers to
 the equivalence class of entities that are lions not made of stone (i.e.
 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Formula $A(x)\wedge L(x)\wedge O(x)\land\lnot S(x)$
\end_inset


\shape default
.
 This is clearly an undesirable result, but simply stipulating that adjectival
 constraints take precedence over nominal constraints is an ad-hoc solution,
 and worse, might not generalize to other composite expressions.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, nominal precedence is the norm (Oliver, 2014).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Oliver's response to this problem is to propose a metaconstraint that requires
 each constituent in a composite expression to contribute something to the
 complex whole of which it is a part.
 This meta-constraint favoring 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full interpretation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Oliver, 2014, p.
 69) forces a ranking in which the constraints associated with the adjective
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 take precedence over the constraints associated with the noun 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would otherwise make no semantic contribution to the meaning of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It helps at this point to compare the proposal developed by Oliver with
 the accounts of constitutive material adjectives mandated by minimalism
 and contextualism.
 Absent some postulation of semantic ambiguity concerning the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the minimalist seems forced to concede that the minimal semantic value
 associated with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the empty set of stone lions.
 Moreover, the explanation of how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is interpreted by ordinary speakers to mean something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

representation of a lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be pushed into the domain of pragmatics.
 It is not clear what form such an explanation ought to take.
 One option would be to appeal to an assumption concerning communicative
 relevance that would rule out a literal interpretation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Choosing this option, though, leaves unanswered the question of 
\shape italic
why 
\shape default
relevance favors a non-literal interpretation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contextualist, on the other hand, is forced to rely on composition rules
 like (1b) and (2b).
 One way to use these rules to explain the difference between privative
 and intersective noun-adjective combinations is to appeal to context parameters.
 In stone-related contexts, for instance, the meaning of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is modulated to describe representations of lions.
 Another option would be to simply ignore context parameters and note that
 if adjectives are treated as functions from nouns to nouns (as in Carpenter,
 1997), then an adjective such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be defined as function that behaves, as it were, privatively when combined
 with nouns like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and intersectively when combined with nouns like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Both of these explanations are inadequate for reasons already discussed.
 The problem is that they introduce new theoretical assumptions to explain
 new semantic phenomena on a roughly one-to-one basis.
 To explain, if new context-parameters or new function definitions are introduce
d into a semantic theory to account for each new phenomenon, then the theory
 runs the risk of having a parameter per observation it is intended to explain.
 Such flexibility is undesirable, since it prevents the theory from being
 restricted in any way by linguistic data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the optimization-based approach, however, there is no needless
 growth in theoretical assumptions.
 Oliver's account requires only two: a lexical semantics that provides basic
 constraints, and a single meta-constraint that favors rankings that allow
 every input into the composition process to make a semantic contribution
 to the output.
 It is fair to say that this account of adjective-noun combinations is more
 explanatory and less ad-hoc than the available alternatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
More General Forms of Composition in Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wish to now suggest that Oliver's approach generalizes to handle a number
 of the phenomena that are of interest to minimalists and contextualists
 alike.
 I consider three of Recanati's examples: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The city is asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've already had breakfast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Give me the lion's sword
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These examples cover the phenomena of loosening, free enrichment, and semantic
 transfer respectively.
 If they can be handled without having to redefine the behavior of some
 set of semantic rules on an ad hoc basis, then there is good reason to
 favor a constraint-based approach over Recanati's alternative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the first example, it is worth noting that Oliver's treatment
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stone lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 essentially uses optimization to perform loosening on the extension of
 the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Thus, a similar explanation of loosening for the constituents in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city is asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ought to suffice.
 To start, it is helpful make some assumptions about the constraints introduced
 by both 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For simplicity, suppose that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 imposes two constraints: that a denoted object is (a) in a state of unconscious
 slumber, and (b) exhibiting little activity.
 Suppose, furthermore, that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 imposes a slightly richer set of constraints: that the denoted object is
 comprised of (a) numerous buildings, (b) numerous roadways, and (c) numerous
 residents.
 The composition of these constituents via the copula 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yields a semantic value that attributes the properties associated with
 sleeping to an entity made up of buildings, roads and people.
 But roads and buildings clearly cannot be in an unconscious slumber, so
 there is a conflict amongst the constraints that must be resolved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If precedence is given to the constraints introduced by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then candidate semantic values satisfying the constraints preferring roads
 and buildings will be ruled out.
 Alternatively, if the precedence is given to the constraints introduced
 by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then candidate semantic values satisfying the constraints preferring slumberin
g will be ruled out.
 The full-interpretation meta-constraint does not discriminate between these
 two alternatives, so it is necessary to appeal to something else.
 My suggestion is to appeal to a different meta-constraint that is sensitive
 to the topic of prior discourse.
 Roughly, this meta-constraint favors a ranking that gives precedence to
 those linguistic constituents that are most related to the topic of conversatio
n.
 So, in sleep-focused conversations, the constraints associated with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be evaluated first.
 In city-focused conversations, the reverse would hold.
 More, of course, needs to be done to flesh out the details of this proposal,
 but it is not ad hoc.
 Plausibly, a topic-driven meta-constraint would account for similar constructio
ns such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the nation is asleep
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the city is jubilant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the school is rioting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, amongst others.
 Postulating this single meta-constraint is, overall, much simpler than
 redefining the behavior of a set of semantic rules each time a new context
 is encountered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To handle the case of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've already had breakfast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, one needs to suppose that the space of candidate semantic values includes
 candidates that specify temporal qualifications (e.g.
 today, yesterday, last year etc.).
 A natural place to introduce the constraints that specify these qualifications
 is through the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

already
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Presumably, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

already
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 introduces constraints consistent with a number of different temporal specifica
tions concerning the clause it modifies.
 These constraints might track standard times such as today, yesterday,
 last week, last month, or last year.
 As such, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

already
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would favor all semantic values that specify a time range as part of their
 truth conditions.
 To further favor the correct time range (i.e.
 today), one can also suppose that event-terms (e.g.
 breakfast, Sunday mass, a birthday, etc.) impose constraints favoring a
 particular frequency of occurrence or a particular time of occurrence.
 For instance, breakfast is something that happens daily, while a birthday
 is something that happens yearly.
 Under these assumptions, a candidate semantic value that takes into account
 the qualifier 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

today
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is automatically preferred, since all the values corresponding to other
 qualifiers violate the constraint concerning frequency of occurrence imposed
 by the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

breakfast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Again, these lexical assumptions are both simple and general.
 For instance, they correctly predict that a sentence such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've already had my birthday
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be enriched to express the proposition < I've already had my birthday
 this year >.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third case, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Give me the lion's sword
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, can actually be handled in much the same way as the first case.
 To explain, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, can be assumed to introduce at least two constraints into the interpretation
 process in the scenario described by Recanati: first, that the optimal
 semantic value refers to a large, furry animal, and second, that it refers
 to a warrior with a lion-decorated shield.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sword
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, on the other hand, can be assumed to introduce a single constraint: that
 the optimal semantic value refers to a sword.
 The possessive 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

's
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, finally, can be taken to favor a semantic value that predicates possession
 of the referent of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sword
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the referent of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Under these assumptions, if the constraint introduced by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the lion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that favors large furry animals is ranked more highly than the constraint
 that favors the warrior with a lion-decorated shield, then the optimal
 semantic content will be one which refers to sword that has impaled the
 lion.
 Alternatively, if the relative ranking of these constraints is reversed,
 then the optimal semantic content will be one which refers to the sword
 used by the warrior.
 Again, postulating a meta-constraint sensitive to the topic of prior discourse
 provides a natural way to choose between these options: in lion-focused
 conversations, the first ranking is preferred; in warrior-focused conversations
, the second ranking is preferred.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, my suggested analyses of Recanati's examples are not meant to be
 complete.
 Much additional work would be needed to provide address these examples
 with a rigor comparable to that used in Oliver's (2014) discussion of noun-adje
ctive combinations.
 This lack of rigor should not be misconstrued as a major weakness though.
 For one thing, neither Recanati nor Cappelen and Lepore provide detailed
 formal analyses of specific linguistic expressions to provide support for
 their claims.
 This is because questions about how such analyses ought to be carried out
 are prior to questions about the analyses themselves.
 Since my discussion, like theirs, is focused on more foundational questions,
 it should be judged by the same standards.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In keeping with these standards, there is a simple way to think about the
 advantage offered by adopting an optimization-based approach.
 When two or more linguistic expressions are composed in a particular context,
 a configuration of input variables (i.e.
 a set of simple meanings and contextual features) are being mapped to an
 output variable (i.e.
 a complex meaning).
 On a rule-based approach, each possible configuration of the input variables
 is mapped to an output by a unique rule.
 This 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

particularism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "p. 3340"
key "Unnsteinsson:2014"

\end_inset

 prevents knowledge of how to treat one input configuration from generalizing
 to other input configurations.
 In short, every case of linguistic composition is, implausibly, a special
 case.
 On an optimization-based approach, by comparison, each variable in the
 input favors a particular output under 
\shape italic
all
\shape default
 circumstances.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that favoring a particular output under all circumstances is simply
 the definition of what a constraint is.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To match each configuration of inputs to an output, one simply needs to
 know the value of each variable and then optimize over a set of candidates
 using the constraints introduced by these values to find the correct output.
 As such, one needs to only learn a finite number of constraints along with
 single process for performing optimization in order to display linguistic
 competence.
 Since the demands imposed on language users by a rule-based theory are
 so much greater, the choice to favor a constraint-based theory is a well-motiva
ted one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is uncontroversially true that speakers can use the same words to say
 different things in different contexts.
 Correctly explaining how this is true is a problem that has occupied philosophe
rs for decades.
 Their proposed solutions typically involve defining rules or functions
 that bring about some observed form of context-sensitivity, either in the
 performance of a speech act or in the assignment of a semantic value.
 Sometimes these rules are stated generally enough to avoid problems associated
 with the learnability of language.
 For example, a rule that composes adjectives and nouns via set intersection
 is general in that it applies regardless of the choice of a particular
 adjective or noun.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note too that even this rule is not entirely general, given the existence
 of privative adjectives.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 But in the case of context-sensitive rules, no such generality is forthcoming.
 Cappelen and Lepore (2005, p.
 200) explicitly doubt the possibility of an algorithmic procedure that
 determines which speech acts are performed by a given utterance in a given
 context.
 Recanati (2012) is more hopeful concerning his own rule-based approach
 to semantics, but Unnsteinnson's critique suggests that the rules in question
 do little to explain linguistic context-sensitivity in the absence of some
 specification of 
\shape italic
how
\shape default
 they behave differently in different contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on these challenges, I have tried to motivate a different kind of
 strategy that seems not to have received much attention in the philosophical
 community: using a finite number of constraints coupled with a finitely
 specified optimization procedure to define a potentially infinite number
 of context-sensitive mappings between simple semantic inputs and complex
 semantic outputs.
 More to the point, this strategy sets out a fairly clear roadmap for the
 development of precise accounts of how context plays a role in the process
 of semantic composition.
 Lexical features impose constraints on how lexical constituents are combined
 - this accounts for the compositionality of linguistic understanding.
 Contextual features impose restrictions on the order in which these lexical
 constraints are ranked - this accounts for the context sensitivity of linguisti
c understanding.
 Contextual features might also impose constraints akin to lexical constraints,
 and thereby more directly influence the composition process.
 Working out the details of how these constraints must be organized to account
 for specific linguistic phenomena is a task for another day, but the considerat
ions offered in this paper hopefully merit the conclusion that it is a task
 worth pursuing.
